# *Chess.css*

**Don't want to write css for the documentation of a project? Use Chess.css! It's simple, fun and stylish. You don't have to give credits, fully open-source, but a star would be appreciated! If you want to give credits you can mention the Github repo!**

# *Contributing*

*If you want to contribute feel free to do a pull request or issue! I will review everyone of the ideas people have so we can create the best css libary. With just one contribution you will be added as a contributor*

# *Supporting*

*If you really find the libary helpful and want to support even more that giving credits a donation would be appreciated, if you don't want to donate you could use the [my code to join replit!](https://join.replit.com/Hugo) and run a Python repl!
